## üå± How to start a project?

Do not clone any repository! Just follow instructions below:


In this practice, we will learn how to use Nmap, a widely recognized open-source tool for network analysis and security. With Nmap, we will perform scans on a target machine (in this case, a Debian machine) from a Kali Linux machine.

We will identify active hosts, open ports on the network, and which services are operating on those ports. This will allow us to search for possible vulnerabilities in the detected services and understand the security weaknesses that may exist in the network.

### Requirements
* Virtual machine with Kali Linux (Scannig machine)
* Virtual machine with Debian (Target machine)
